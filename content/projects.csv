Draper Laboratory - Software Engineering Intern,"I worked with the human centered engineering group at Draper to design and develop an app for Google glass, over the summer. The app dynamically displayed visual cues, and was responsive as the user turned their head. My work was part of the immersive situational awareness research project, which was testing different methods of conveying information about surroundings. Throughout the summer, I concurrently designed the app with human centered design techniques and feedback from the rest of my team, and did the software development for a web-app and google glass app. I had not done Android programming prior to this, so I also learned some Android development along the way.",,,Draper-Map.jpg,"Android development, Wearable technology, Web development, Human centered design",Independent Project within Human Centered Engineering Department,Summer 2015
Refugee Data Visualization,"For our Data Visualization class, I worked with two people to create a visualization of refugees moving around the world over time. This was based off a dataset from the UN, and was drawn on a map using the GEOJson library in D3.",http://anishan.github.io/dataviz_final_project/,https://github.com/anishan/dataviz_final_project,Refugees-Screenshot.jpg,"JavaScript, D3, SQLite",Team of Three,2015
Lazer Maze,"You know those scenes in spy movies where a character breaks into an important building and nimbly navigates a maze of laser beam tripwires? For our course Principles of Engineering, a mechatronics course, my team created a laser maze experience where players attempt to navigate an obstacle course as quickly as possible without breaking the laser beams. Our project focused on integrating software, electrical, and mechanical systems. We created a web GUI for the game interface, which detected breaks in the moving laser beams through sensors connected to a raspberry pi.",http://poe.olin.edu/2015/lazermaze/,https://github.com/anishan/poe-2015,LazerMaze-SystemDiagram.png,"Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Sensors and signal processing, Circuit prototyping, Python, Flask, Agile development, Soldering, Gameplay design",Team of Five,2015
Natural Resource Modeling,"As an independent study, I'm studying different mathematical models for modeling resource use, especially in the context of agriculture and food systems. After I learn more about existing models, I will be researching a system and constraints, in order to design and implement a mathematical model.",,,,"MATLAB, Modeling",Independent Project,2016
News Article Sentiment Analyzer,"For my software design course, I created an algorithm to compare different news sources by analyzing the sentiment of articles. I thought that by looking at trends in reporting, it would be possible to see bias in the news. For a given event, the program finds the primary news articles about that event for different news companies. The first part of the program involves web scraping (with the pattern.web Google API) to find the most relevant article from each news source. Then, after a bit of HTML scraping, the program uses the pattern.en sentiment analyzer to determine  how positive/negative and how subjective/objective the article is. I graphed the results with the numpy package.

You can see some of the final graphs in the images. I ran the analyzer for the State of the Union Address (Jan 2015), the People's Climate March in New York (Sept 2015), and the Keystone Pipeline Veto (Feb 2015). Even with just these three events, you can see a trend in how different news companies report on certain topics.",,https://github.com/anishan/news_analysis,NewsBias-ClimateMarch.png,"Python, Web scraping, Numpy library, Pattern library",Independent Project,2015
Recipe Finder Program,"Working with a team of three, we created web-app to search for recipes based on the ingredients available to the user. As college students, we often get frustrated by recipes that call for ingredients that we might not have easily available. Our program, written in python, allows users to store a pantry of standard ingredients through a database in MongoDB, and then searches the Yummly API for recipes that match the criteria. We interfaced with the web GUI with Flask.",http://aconsilvio.github.io/recipe_program/,https://github.com/aconsilvio/recipe_program,Recipes-Screenshot.jpg,"Python, MongoDB, Flask, Server Management (basic)",Team of Three,2015
Aquaponics System,"I helped to start a new chapter of Net Impact by Design on campus, where we are promoting engineering build projects with a social or environmental impact. Our first project was building a small-scale aquaponics system to learn methods of growing food inside. I helped lead the electrical subteam, and we worked on controlling the lights and water pump on a timer through a web application.",,,Aquaponics-Plants.jpg,"Raspberry Pi, Power control (basic), Leadership",Project Build Team,2015-present
Chameleon Toy with Microcontroller,"For our Design Nature class, we designed a game experience for fourth graders using concepts from biomimicry. My team created a color changing chameleon with color-changing LEDs, that we controlled with a ATMega328 microcontroller (programmed with Arduino).",,,Chameleon-Photo.jpg,"Arduino, Protoboard soldering, Solidworks, Design",Team of Five,2014
Sustainability Club (GROW),"I'm co-leading the sustainability club at Olin, where we have been working on campus-wide  initiatives. We have worked with facilities to make drying racks available in all the laundry rooms, which has lead to a noticeable decrease in dryer use and energy. We have also worked with the dining hall to introduce reusable travel cups as an alternative to paper cups, which has contributed to a 10-15% decrease in paper cup usage.",,,GROW-cups.jpg,Leadership,Club,2014-present
Modeling Wolf Populations in Yellowstone,"In my Modeling and Simulation class, I modeled the effect of re-introducing wolves into the Yellowstone ecosystem through a conservation effort in 1995. I also modeling the subsequent changes in the elk and aspen species, as the wolves controlled the elk population, which allowed the aspen to recover. I also validated this model with data from the National Parks Service.",,,Wolves-TimeSeries.jpg,"MATLAB, Modeling",Independent Project,2014
