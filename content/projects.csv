Lazer Maze,"You know those scenes in spy movies where a character breaks into an important building and nimbly navigates a maze of laser beam tripwires? For our course Principles of Engineering, a mechatronics course, my team created a laser maze experience where players attempt to navigate an obstacle course as quickly as possible without breaking the laser beams. Our project focusing on integrating software, electrical, and mechanical systems. We created a web GUI for the game interface, which detected breaks in the moving laser beams through sensors connected to a raspberry pi.",http://poe.olin.edu/2015/lazermaze/,https://github.com/anishan/poe-2015,,,,
Aquaponics System,"I helped to start a new chapter of Net Impact by Design on campus, where we are promoting engineering build projects with a social or environmental impact. Our first project was buildign a small-scale aquaponics system to learn methods of growing food inside. I helped lead the electrical subteam, and we worked on controling the lights and water pump on a timer through a web application.",,,,,,
News Article Sentiment Analyzer,"For my software design course, I created an algorithm to compare different news sources by analyzing the sentiment of articles. I thought that by looking at trends in reporting, it would be possible to see bias in the news. For a given event, the program finds the primary news articles about that event for different news companies. The first part of the program involves web scraping (with the pattern.web Google API) to find the most relevant article from each news source. Then, after a bit of HTML scraping, the program uses the pattern.en sentiment analyzer to determine  how positive/negative and how subjective/objective the article is. I graphed the results with the numpy package.

You can see some of the final graphs in the images. I ran the analyzer for the State of the Union Address (Jan 2015), the People's Climate March in New York (Sept 2015), and the Keystone Pipeline Veto (Feb 2015). Even with just these three events, you can see a trend in how different news companies report on certain topics.",,,,,,
Recipe Finder Program,"Working with a team of three, we created web-app to search for recipes based on the ingrdients available to the user. As college students, we often get frustrated by recipes that call for ingredients that we might not have easily available. Our program, written in python, allows users to store a pantry of standard ingredients through a database in MongoDB, and then searchs the Yummly API for recipes that match the critera. We interfaced with the web GUI with Flask.",,,,,,
Chameleon Toy with Microcontroller,"For our Design Nature class, we designed a game experience for fourth graders using concepts from biomimicry. My team created a cocolor changing chameleon with color-changing LEDs, that we controlled with a ATMega328 microcontroller (programmed with Arduino).",,,,,,
Sustainability Club (GROW),"I'm co-leading the GROW club at Olin, where we have been working on campus-wide sustainability initiatives. We have worked with facilities to make drying racks available in all the laundry rooms, which has lead to a noticable decrease in dryer use and energy. We have also worked with the dining hall to introduce reusable travel cups as an alternative to paper cups, which has contributed to a 10-15% decrease in paper cup usage.",,,,,,
Refugee Data Visualization,"For our Data Visualization class, I worked with two people to create a visualization of refugees moving around the world over time. This was based off a dataset from the UN, and was drawn on a map using the GEOJson library in D3.",,,,,,
Modeling Wolf Populations in Yellowstone,"In my Modeling and Simulation class, I modeled the effect of re-introducing wolves into the Yellowstone ecosystem through a conservation effort in 1995. I also modeling the subsequent changes in the elk and aspen species, as the wolves controlled the elk population, which allowed the aspen to recover. I also validated this model with data from the National Parks Service.",,,,,,
